# Implementation of Semantic Image Synthesis with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization
PyTorch unofficial implementation of Semantic Image Synthesis with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization paper by Nvidia Research.

The main notebook now has the implementation of all the models (encoder, generator, discriminator, spade_cell, spade_resblk).

Next thing to do. Create seperate .py scripts and add parser arguments for everything. Will create a new notebook to train my own model (for that I will have to half almost everything, including spade filters and also possibly try fp16 instead of fp32.
